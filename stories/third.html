    <h3 class="author">© Stella Wei</h3>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, on a farm by a peaceful pond, a mother duck waited eagerly for her eggs to hatch. One by one, the eggs cracked open, and fluffy ducklings emerged, except for one. The last egg was larger than the others, and when it finally hatched, the mother duck was surprised to see a strange-looking duckling. Unlike the others, this duckling was big and gray, and everyone called him ugly.

      The ugly duckling tried to fit in with his siblings, but they teased and mocked him for being different. Feeling sad and lonely, the ugly duckling wandered away from the pond, hoping to find a place where he belonged. Throughout his journey, the ugly duckling encountered other animals who also rejected him because of his appearance. He faced many challenges and hardships, but he never lost hope. As the seasons changed, the ugly duckling grew bigger and stronger. </p>
    <p>
      One day, he saw a beautiful flock of swans gliding gracefully on a nearby lake. He wished he could be like them. To his surprise, the other swans welcomed him with open wings, embracing him as one of their own. The ugly duckling looked at his reflection in the water and realized he was no longer ugly. He had transformed into a magnificent swan. Now, the ugly duckling lived happily ever after, surrounded by friends who loved and accepted him for who he was.Pre reading activities for primary school children
